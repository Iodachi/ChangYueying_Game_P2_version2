# TheGame Version 2
Game concept & Description
Because I feel like the original version of our game was too little to show, I made this version of the game which still has the key mechanics of player interact with launchpad, but this time with a infinite runner background where the camera is constantly moving upwards with platforms in different widths generated on the map, and player have to jump all the time in order not to fall to the groud and die. The launchpads and spikes are sometimes generated on the platforms to make it more fun and challenging. There are three powerups in the game, blue gem to slow down the camera, yellow gem to be invincible to the spikes, and purple gem for super jumps, the powerups will all last for 5 seconds.

Player can prese A and D to move and space to jump, the gems are automatically picked up when player touches them.

Installation & setup

Simply download the repository and import into unity to run.

Challenges

I found it really hard to put the platforms and items in the right place, I figured out how to put them on where they should be, for example not outside the camera and spikes and launchpads not below the platforms, however, it is still really challenging to make them appear in a reasonable way, for example for now the platforms are generated with three random widths whereas there should not always have short ones to be generated in a period of time to make it too hard, and the gems should generate in certain places so that it is reasonably hard for players to get but not hard enough so that they could easily kill themselves when try to retreive them. There are still some flaws in the game such as the spikes and launchpads sometimes stack together, these are to be fixed in the future.
